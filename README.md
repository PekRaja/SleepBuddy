# sleepbuddy
Sleep buddy group of International Project 2019
This repo is subdivided into 3 folders, the names are quite self-explanatory:
- "arduino-code": this is where the hardware team stores the C/C++ files with the microcontroller logic.
- "mobile-app": this is the main focus for the software team and holds an ionic application that is portable to different mobile platforms.
- "web-app": this is where the additional web interface is stored.
